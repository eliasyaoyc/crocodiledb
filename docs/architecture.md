## Overview
Crocodile is a distributed SQL database in Rust, written as a learning project but i hope it can be used in production.
the components including:
* Linearization based on Raft distributed consensus algorithm
* ACID-compliant transaction engine with MVCC-based snapshot isolation.
* Alternative storage engines with B+tree and log-structured.
* SQL layer satisfies generality, e.g. join,aggregates adn transactions.
